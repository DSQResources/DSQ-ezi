# Will you be using any pre-existing data (including other people's data)?

*[Data Stewardship Wizard] Question - additional resources*

Short UID: ezi

## The Question

Will you be referring to any earlier measured data, reference data, or data that should be mined from existing literature? Your own data as well as data from others?

### Possible answers:

  * No (*Advice*: Did you research all the data that exists? You may not be aware of all existing data that could be available. Although using and/or integrating existing data sets may pose a challenge, it will normally be cheaper than collecting everything yourself. Even if you decide not to use an existing data set, it is better to do this as a conscious decision.)
  * Yes
